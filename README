## Introduction
In the lecture, we learned node features of GNNs tend to become more similar with the increase of the network depth. This is known as the **over-smoothing** problem. Intuituvely, as the depth of network grows, the range over which nodes exchange information widens. As learning processes, local information get diluted, and the importance of global information increases, leading to the similarity of feature vectors for much more nodes. This naturally triggers a question: "How can we determine the depth of network to avoid the over-smoothing problem and optimize the learning process?"

In the case of GNNs, when the number of layers is $k$, then each node interacts with its $k$-hop neighborhoods. The extent of overlap between the $k$-hop neighborhoods of two nodes(receptive field) will determine how similar their feature vectors converge. We aim to investigate the relationship between the overlap of $k$-hop neighborhoods between nodes and the over-smoothing caused by network depth in GNNs.
